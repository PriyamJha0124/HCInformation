Hi Everyone.
Me and my child have gone through tremendous domestic violence during my marriage of 1.5 years. Now the case is in family court. Child Protection have said that they would be concerned if there was any contact with father of the baby (even FaceTime) due to the history of violence involved. 
Currently, the case is in family court. We have had the first hearing and did not attach our evidence with our affidavit ( which I think was a mistake) and the judge ordered supervised visits. 
Now Family Report and an ICL have been appointed next month, after which there is an interim hearing three months later in July. 
When is the best time to attach all the evidence? (Reports, affidavits by various people about his abuse to me, etc) I don’t want to give enough time for the op to prepare as he is a master liar and a manipulator. What is the best strategy for showing the evidence to court - is it through family reporter, ICL or attaching it as evidence for interim hearing?
Thank you in advance for your help
